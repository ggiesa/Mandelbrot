# Mandlebrot

Goals of this project:
- Perform Mandlebrot calculations as fast as possible with Cpython and Numba
- Display the Mandlebrot set as quickly and beautifully as possible with D3
- Allow the user to zoom via intuitive click and drag operations  

Features I'd like to add eventually:
- Video generation at set resolutions and framerates
- Automatic path finding
- Custom coloration options
